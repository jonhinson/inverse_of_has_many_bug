== Details

Included is a single test that demonstrates this issue. It seems to have been introduced with https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/12359. If https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v3.2.16/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations/has_many_association.rb#L12 is commented out, the test will pass.

It basically boils down to when a callback of the has_many association calls a method on the parent object that calls the has many association.
